# EddieMUD  
Python MUD Concept  
Nothing remarkable here, this is just for concepting ideas, and testing technologies while I mess with them.  
No timeline on completion, although I will likely do a very loose roadmap on features I'd like to implement.  

Setup:
```
python -m venv venv
. ./venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run:
```
PYTHONPATH=./src/python python -m EddieMUD.main
```
